# Author Tags

Author Tags are used to store information about an author in a centralised way, allowing librarianettes to add consistent author metadata to every book by an author.

## Prerequisites

1. You must be using Google Chrome. While we hope to support other browsers in the future, Chrome is the only browser supported at the moment.

1. You must be logged in with a Google account associated with the Better LibraryThing project.
If you are a volunteer librarianette for VBL, you will find this account in the volunteer resources.
Otherwise, you can request that _your_ Google account be added.
   ### Logging In

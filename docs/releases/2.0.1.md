# Release Notes

## New Features

- A book's location will be omitted from a book's comments when using the copy and paste feature.
- Tag Index future proofing: Better LibraryThing will now let you know if it thinks it doesn't know how to read the Tag Index
  (which would indicate that Better LibraryThing is out of date).

## Bug Fixes

- Copying and pasting a book's physical description now works.
- The warning you get when you can't access a Tag Index can no longer be exited (as was intended).

## Other Changes

- Some tweaks to some animations.
- Minor behind the scenes improvements for the developers.

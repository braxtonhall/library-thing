# Release Notes

## New Features
- If you get the upper/lower casing wrong on a tag, it will be automatically fixed on save.

## Changes
- Nested tags are no longer inserted automatically, and are instead inserted using the "Add ancestor tags" button.
- When you paste a book, it no longer pastes the barcode.
- Pasting a book now works on the manual book entry page.
- Minor behind the scenes improvements for the developers.

## Bug Fixes
- Checking whether you're on the latest version was not working as intended in 1.3.0, but we think we fixed it.

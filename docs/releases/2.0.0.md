# Release Notes

## Breaking Changes
- You are required to add a link to the Tag Index in the Better LibraryThing settings. See the [Tag Index document](https://betterlibrarything.com/docs/librarian/tag-index.md.pretty) for more information.
- Better LibraryThing will no longer tell you if there is a new update available.

## New Features
- We're published on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-librarything/hbnlneckiahefebnpdhgpohonfkkcaln) and [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterlibrarything/)!
- You can now log in using any Google account to manage tags.
- You can now copy a book's metadata for pasting from your book catalog, and from a book's details page.
- If you have forgotten to add a content warning, Better LibraryThing will let you know before saving.
- When you hover over the "Paste book" button, it will tell you what's on the clipboard.
- [Tag remapping](https://betterlibrarything.com/docs/librarian/tag-index-management.md.pretty) allow a VBL librarian to add many tags to the Tag Index very quickly.

## Other Changes
- We have a [website](https://betterlibrarything.com/) now? Check it out I guess?
- Major behind the scenes improvements for the developers.

# Release Notes

## New Features

- Nested tags! If you add a tag like "1st-3rd grade", then "children's" will automatically get added to the book when you save.
- Tag validation! You'll be warned if you try to save a tag that's not in the Tag Index.
- Changing a book title's sorting will now show you what the book will be sorted as directly on the form.
- Author tags now support autocompletion.
- What's new? There's a good chance you're seeing this page because the extension suggested you check it out. That's a new feature!

## Changes

- PDF and summary searches will now stop searching after ten seconds.
- Logging out of your Google account will now properly update the page you're on to show you are logged out.
- The LibraryThing banner will now also be greyed out if you're not logged in to a Google account, as you would be missing out on the new safety features.
- Form resize saving now also applies to the author page.
- Minor behind the scenes improvements for the developers.
